Numpy_GetRidOfTheMathesaurus
============================

Codelab for introducing Python and Numpy to scientists and engineers.

The codelab contains a guided track and a didactical script that gives a fast and complete introduction to Python, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.

At the end a pair of simple exercises are left to be completed by the students.

To start the lab just point your terminal in this directory and type "jupyter notebook" and select Lab1.ipynb; this open a notebook that provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with:

   * A powerful interactive shell.
   * Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
   * Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into your own projects.
