    "You have been guided through the first steps of numpy and matplotlib libraries, however the things that you can do with those library are much more. In fact, in this tutorial important aspects such as array arithmetical operations, array broadcasting, reshaping and resizing are omitted. However, start- ing from this basic knowledge and the online documentations I am sure you can get really far very fast. For those of you that are use to Matlab and feel lazy about study new technologies, I would suggest to take a look at this address: http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html. It contains all the most common Matlab functions translated to the correspondent numpy method. At this web address http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/tutorials.php you can find some really interesting and high quality tutorials, where you can improve your knowledge of the libraries.\n"
